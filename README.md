# Convex Polygon Detection using Linear Hough Transform

Polygon detection framework written in C that implements a deriche edge detector for blurring, calculation of magnitude and gradient direction, non-maximum suppresion, and hystersis thresholding. As a final step, it performs a Hough transform to detect the number and orientation of each polygon edge in the source image.

## System Overview

### Stage 1: Read Bitmap as Matrix

### Stage 2: Deriche Blur Filter

### Stage 3: Otsu's Thresholder

### Stage 4: Deriche Gradient Filter

### Stage 5: Hysteresis Thresholding

### Stage 6: Hough Transform

### Stage 7: Edge Count & Orientation
