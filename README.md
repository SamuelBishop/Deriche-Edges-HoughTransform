# Convex Polygon Detection using Linear Hough Transform
Polygon detection framework for bitmap images written in C that implements Otsu's thresholding and a Deriche edge detector for blurring, calculation of magnitude and gradient direction, non-maximum suppression and hysteresis thresholding. As a final step, it performs a Hough transform to detect the number and orientation of each polygon edge in the source image.
